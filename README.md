# ESP32_IR_IoT_hub

ESP32-based IR receiver for IoT

** WORK IN PROGRESS **

This is an ESP32-based infrared receiver intended to be used with standard infrared remote controls.

The idea is to have a single receiver that can be used to control multiple devices in the home by sending out MQTT messages and/or interacting with a REST API on an intranet server.
